      <h2> Founder and Owner </h2>
      <p> I was one of the earlies digital evangelicals, 
        moving from traditional journalism to the internet
         in 1995 when it was still a fledgling. I was a digital strategist,
          senior manager, leader and revenue-generator at The Washington Post, 
          ABCNEWS and The Globe and Mail from 1995 to 2017,
           when I launched Conquest Communications Canada.

        <h2>Jim Sheppard</h2>
        <h2> Founder and Owner </h2>
        <p>When I joined the digital arm of The Washington Post in 1995 after being a foreign correspondent and newsroom leader for many years, 
          my friends complimented me at getting a job at such a prestigious organization,
           but then asked me: “Why are you leaving journalism to go into the internet?”
            That was almost 30 years ago,
             when it was impossible to imagine how the digital world would shake 
             the foundations of “reality” in all the ways we take for granted today. </br></br>
          However, I believe the sweeping changes of the past three decades will pale in comparison to what 
          lies ahead in a world where digital plays an ever-expanding role.</br></br>
          I thrive on those kinds of challenges. I have played many roles in the digital world.
           Since 2017 when I launched Conquest Communications, my company, my consultants and I have worked with organizations and individuals,
            providing our strategic advice, as well as our writing and editing services,
             which are unique and tailored to each small business or organization</br></br>
          My background before launching Conquest Communications was in journalism.
           I was deputy editor of washingtonpost.com, as well as one of its editorial founders;
            news manager and editorial founder of ABCNEWS.com; and executive editor of globeandmail.com from 2005 to 2017.</br></br>
          Prior to that, I was a foreign correspondent and newsroom leader for The Canadian Press.
           My key postings were Moscow chief correspondent (bureau chief) during the years on either 
           side of the fall of the former Soviet Union in 1991; London chief correspondent (twice);
            Ottawa news editor during the Pierre Trudeau and Brian Mulroney administrations; 
            and beat reporter for the Reform Party after the 1993 election that brought Jean Chretien to power.

        <h2>Hayley Mundeva</h2>
      <h3>Communications Specialist</h3>
      <p> I used to confine communications to social media marketing. But now I understand its broader purpose. 
        It can shape the way we see the world and, in many cases, it can influence our perception of our place within it.</br></br>
        For example, a captivating video can alter how people view an issue. 
        Or a carefully crafted impact report can persuade an audience to donate to a worthy cause.</br></br>
        My journey to this discovery, and to communications work more generally, wasn’t linear however.</br>
        I began my career in public health research but soon discovered a passion for creating pitches and infographics.
         When I later realized that I could combine my love for writing, photography and art into an impactful career, I was set.</br></br>
        Now based in Tanzania, I've completed a masters degree and gained more than eight ears of experience working at the intersection of communications and development.
         My clients span private businesses to non-profits and are located in countries across East Africa, Southeast Asia and North America.</br></br>
        Some of these include Girl Effect, Plan International, the Canadian Coalition for Global Health Research and the AlphaMundi Foundation.</br></br>
        I specialize in strategy development, branding and crafting complex information into accessible content such as websites, articles, slide decks, videos and more.</br></br>
        Through these activities, I've helped organizations gain clarity about their customers and marketing, 
        ways to improve their brand image, and how to build trust with key stakeholders. In turn, these efforts have helped them to develop new partnerships,
         raise critical funding and scale their impacts.</br></br>

    <p> I’m happiest making a good story great. For more than a decade at The Globe and Mail, I wore many hats – homepage editor,

      What headline best sums up the thrust of the story and why should the reader give us their most precious commodity – time? 
      I know what works and what doesn’t.</br></br>
       At Conquest Communications Canada, I apply that expertise to helping our clients focus on their overall approach to their audience,
